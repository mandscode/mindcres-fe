                                    Snoring occurs when turbulent air vibrates the soft tissues in your airway. During sleep, throat and nasal tissues relax, and the tongue collapses, narrowing the airway and causing turbulence.

                                Various factors, such as age, weight gain, alcohol and tobacco use, and sleep position, can contribute to snoring. However, effective solutions focus on widening and keeping the airway clear of obstruction and turbulent air, regardless of contributing factors.

                            Snoring affects your sleep quality, leading to various negative outcomes. Sleep deprivation can result in weight gain, mood disturbances, reduced focus, accidents, work inefficiency, and strained relationships. Furthermore, snoring is linked to health issues like high blood pressure, heart disease, diminished sexual function, diabetes, and stroke. Additionally, snoring also impacts the sleep quality of bed partners, with an average loss of one hour of sleep per night.

                            <span>
                            Furthermore, the repetitive vibration of tissues in the airway during snoring can cause inflammation and irritation, leading to a sore throat, dry mouth, and headaches. Over time, this chronic irritation may even contribute to the development of more serious conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma.
